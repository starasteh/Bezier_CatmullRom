This is the official repository of the paper "Conversion Between Cubic Bezier Curves and Catmull–Rom Splines", published as OpenAccess on July 31, 2021 in the Springer Nature Computer Science Journal, see here [Conversion Between Cubic Bezier Curves and Catmull–Rom Splines](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-021-00770-x). The preprint of the paper is available [here on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08232).

This project was a part of the vision-based navigation research at the [Chair of Information Technology (LIKE)](https://www.like.tf.fau.de/) at Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg.


## Prerequisites

The codes here were initially intended to be used within **C#** and the **Unity 3D** game engine.

We are working on a **Python** implementation for easier use and increased transparency regarding the research.
